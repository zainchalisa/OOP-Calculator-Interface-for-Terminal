Object Oriented Calculator (Java Program)

This is a calculator designed to read 2 integer inputs from the user and either add, subtract, mulitply, or divide based on what the user chooses.

I coded this program after my first semester learning computer science. 
I have further improved it by creating a interface where the user can choose what type of computation they are looking to calculate. 
I think this is a lot more advantageous than giving all the computations to the user at once. 
Being able to choose improves the end-users expereince which at the end of the day is the most important aspect of your code.

I plan on further improving this program by creating a UI design that works on the outside of the terminal in the coming few months. 
I will update the program files once finished.
